üß† Alzheimer Detector - Full Project Guide

Project Overview

Alzheimer Detector is an AI-powered healthcare tool designed to analyze brain MRI images and predict the stage of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.
It provides instant predictions using a deep learning model trained on real-world datasets, helping doctors, researchers, and patients with early diagnosis.



Technologies Used
	‚Ä¢	Python: Main programming language
	‚Ä¢	TensorFlow + Keras: For building, training, and saving the deep learning model
	‚Ä¢	Flask: For creating the lightweight web application
	‚Ä¢	Tailwind CSS: For professional, mobile-responsive frontend styling
	‚Ä¢	HTML5: For creating user-friendly web pages
	‚Ä¢	Jupyter Notebook: For data preprocessing, model training
	‚Ä¢	Pandas, Numpy: For data handling
	‚Ä¢	Matplotlib: For visualizing training results



Dataset Details
	‚Ä¢	Source: Alzheimer‚Äôs MRI dataset (open medical datasets)
	‚Ä¢	Classes/Labels:
	‚Ä¢	üß† Non Demented: No signs of Alzheimer‚Äôs
	‚Ä¢	üß† Very Mild Demented: Very early, slight signs
	‚Ä¢	üß† Mild Demented: Noticeable but manageable cognitive decline
	‚Ä¢	üß† Moderate Demented: Clear symptoms affecting daily life

Each MRI image is labeled according to the disease stage, allowing our model to learn and distinguish between different severities.



How We Trained the Model
	‚Ä¢	Model Architecture:
We used Transfer Learning based on VGG16 (a very powerful convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet).
	‚Ä¢	Fine-Tuning:
We froze early layers and fine-tuned the later layers specifically for MRI brain scan features.
	‚Ä¢	Image Preprocessing:
	‚Ä¢	Resized all images to 224x224
	‚Ä¢	Normalized pixel values to range [0,1]
	‚Ä¢	Augmentation:
	‚Ä¢	Applied slight rotations, flips, and zoom to improve model generalization.
	‚Ä¢	Optimization:
	‚Ä¢	Optimizer: Adam
	‚Ä¢	Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
	‚Ä¢	Early stopping based on validation loss to prevent overfitting.
	‚Ä¢	Final Model:
	‚Ä¢	Saved as VGG16.h5 after achieving high validation accuracy.



How It Works (User Flow)
	1.	User uploads a Brain MRI image from the upload form.
	2.	‚ö° Flask sends the image to the server.
	3.	Our trained VGG16 model predicts the most likely Alzheimer‚Äôs stage.
	4.	User sees the prediction instantly, along with suggested next medical actions.
	5.	Recommendations include visiting neurologists, scheduling further tests, or monitoring health.

Features
	‚Ä¢	Upload any MRI image easily through the web app.
	‚Ä¢	Fast, real-time predictions (within seconds).
	‚Ä¢	Clean, professional UI styled with Tailwind CSS.
	‚Ä¢	Hover animations, marquee scrolling, and responsive design for desktop and mobile.
	‚Ä¢	Complete About, FAQ, and Suggested Actions sections.
	‚Ä¢	Highly secure: No data is permanently stored.


Why Alzheimer Detector is Important
	‚Ä¢	üß† Early detection gives patients a better chance to manage Alzheimer‚Äôs.
	‚Ä¢	‚è≥ Timely interventions can slow disease progression.
	‚Ä¢	ü©∫ Support healthcare professionals with AI-powered assistance.
	‚Ä¢	üß™ Promote research into Alzheimer‚Äôs treatments.
