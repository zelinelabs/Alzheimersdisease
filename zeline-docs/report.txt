Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

Problem Statement
Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects millions globally. Early and accurate detection is critical to slow progression and improve patient outcomes. Manual diagnosis through MRI is time-consuming and subjective.

Abstract
This project develops an AI-powered solution using deep learning techniques to automate the detection and classification of Alzheimer's Disease from brain MRI scans. By leveraging transfer learning and modern web technologies, we deliver a fast, reliable, and user-friendly diagnostic support tool.

Methodology
- Data Collection: Alzheimer's MRI dataset from public medical sources
- Preprocessing: Image normalization, resizing, and augmentation
- Model Training: Fine-tuning VGG16 pre-trained CNN
- Deployment: Flask web server integrated with the trained model
- Frontend: Tailwind CSS and responsive UI for easy user interaction
- Testing and Validation: Ensuring high prediction accuracy and user experience

Objectives
- To automate the classification of Alzheimer's disease stages.
- To assist healthcare professionals with faster preliminary diagnosis.
- To provide a simple, accessible platform for MRI analysis.

Technology Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Flask
- HTML5, Tailwind CSS
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy, Pandas

Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5 + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **AI Model:** VGG16 fine-tuned for MRI classification
- **Database:** None (no user data stored)
- **Deployment:** Localhost (can be extended to AWS/GCP)

Model Used
- **VGG16 (Transfer Learning)**
- Fine-tuned on Alzheimer's MRI dataset
- Classification into: Non-Demented, Very Mild Demented, Mild Demented, Moderate Demented

Conclusion
The Alzheimer Detector successfully predicts different stages of Alzheimer's Disease from brain MRI images. It reduces diagnostic time, assists doctors, and promotes early intervention strategies. Future improvements can involve multi-modal data fusion and cloud-based deployment.
